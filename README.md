# 📊 Sales Forecasting Dashboard  

This initiative was developed as a key part of my **Machine Learning Internship with Future Interns**. The core goal was to predict future sales trends and construct an **interactive dashboard** to deliver crucial business insights.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
- A robust **time series forecasting model** was created using **Facebook Prophet**.  
- The findings and key performance indicators were visualized using **Power BI**.  
- I conducted an analysis of historical trends to accurately predict future sales performance.  
- The model's accuracy was assessed using standard metrics: **MAE, RMSE, and MAPE**.  

## 📂 Features  
✅ Forecasted daily sales with clear confidence intervals  

✅ Visual comparison of actual sales versus predicted sales trends

✅ Dedicated KPI cards to display actual and forecasted sales figures  

✅ Detailed error analysis through residual plotting  

✅ Insights broken down by product category  

✅ User-friendly, interactive dashboard filters 


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, Prophet, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & KPI Dashboards)  

## 📈 Model Performance  
- **MAE:** 1.05  
- **RMSE:** 1.35  
- **MAPE:** 19.48%
