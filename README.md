📊 Sales Forecasting Dashboard
This initiative was developed as a key part of my Machine Learning Internship at Future Interns. The core goal was to predict future sales trends and construct an interactive dashboard to deliver crucial business insights.

🚀 Project Overview
A robust time series forecasting model was created using Facebook Prophet.

The findings and key performance indicators were visualized using Power BI.

I conducted an analysis of historical trends to accurately predict future sales performance.

The model's accuracy was assessed using standard metrics: MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

📂 Features
✅ Forecasted daily sales with clear confidence intervals
✅ Visual comparison of actual sales versus predicted sales trends
✅ Dedicated KPI cards to display actual and forecasted sales figures
✅ Detailed error analysis through residual plotting
✅ Insights broken down by product category 
✅ User-friendly, interactive dashboard filters

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Prophet, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Power BI (Data Visualization & KPI Dashboards)

📈 Model Performance
MAE: 1.05

RMSE: 1.35

MAPE: 19.48%
